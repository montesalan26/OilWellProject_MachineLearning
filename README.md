This Machine Learning Project, I took three different datasets of 3 different oil well regions, and I analyzed the average profit and risk loss percentage to determine what would be the best region
to create new oil wells.  

Libraries Required for this project:  


import pandas as pd  
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt  
import numpy as np  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
